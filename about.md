<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    My name is Kieran Hayes. I'm a software engineer based in Dublin, Ireland.<br />
    My experiences and hobbies are within the gaming industry, where I have over a decade of experience.
</p>
<p>
    Most notably I have created and maintained customer service applications & systems for <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/" target="_blank">Blizzard Entertainment</a><br />
    This includes end to end support for AAA titles such as:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://playoverwatch.com/" target="_blank">Overwatch</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://playhearthstone.com/" target="_blank">Hearthstone</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://diablo3.com/" target="_blank">Diablo III</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://starcraft2.com/" target="_blank">StarCraft II</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
    As a 4-5 year old child I picked up a magazine that taught you how to program in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_BASIC" target="_blank">Sinclair BASIC</a>. Ever since then I have been hooked on teaching myself how to design and create software.
</p>
<p>
    I don't consider myself to be someone who only rights code. I have experience in multimedia, design, lecturing, customer support, operations and engineering. My passion is to build quality products end to end, and to consider the whole spectrum of what that entails. From the code that is written and executed, to what the development and user experience is surrounding that.
